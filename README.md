# Heart Companion
 
Heart Companion is a simple solution for people who cannot make frequent visits to the doctor. It's an ML based app that uses University of California Irvine's Open Source Health Repository (obtained from 3 different countries across the world) to determine whether one has a chance of heart disease. By using a regression graph, one can somewhat validate a possible probability of heart disease given certain input. The input required for this companion to work includes one's age, sex, whether they smoke (y/n), cholesterol, resting BPS, max heart rate, and whether they have diabetes (y/n). This is a simple app that can probably make a big difference! Give it a shot soon!
